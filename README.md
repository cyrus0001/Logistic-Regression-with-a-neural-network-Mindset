# Logistic-Regression-with-a-neural-network-Mindset

This repository contains code and resources for implementing logistic regression using a neural network mindset, with a focus on image classification. Logistic regression, when framed within the context of neural networks, provides a powerful tool for binary classification tasks, such as distinguishing between cat and non-cat images.

## Overview
In this repository, you will find:

- Implementation: Python code for building and training a logistic regression model using a neural network approach.
- Datasets: Sample datasets for training and testing the logistic regression model, including cat and non-cat images.
- Documentation: Jupyter notebooks and documentation explaining the concepts and implementation details.
- Usage Examples: Examples demonstrating how to use the implemented logistic regression model for image classification tasks.
  
## General Achitecture of Learning Algorithm 
You will build a Logistic Regression, using a Neural Network mindset. The following Figure explains why Logistic Regression is actually a very simple Neural Network!

# Installation
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/logistic-regression-with-a-neural-network-mindset.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
## Image Classification
To predict whether an image contains a cat or not:

Prepare your image file (e.g., cat.jpg) and place it in the images/ directory.

Run the provided Python script to perform the prediction: python predict_image.py --image cat.jpg

This will output the prediction result (cat or non-cat) based on the logistic regression model.
